# FalconDive Website Redesign Plan
## BUSINESS TRUTHS. DELIVERED NOW.

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a complete redesign of the FalconDive website, inspired by the sophisticated design language of Pixelik Studio. The redesign transforms the current corporate B2B aesthetic into an immersive, cinematic experience that tells the story of a falcon's hunt — from observation at altitude to precision strike — mirroring FalconDive's AI-powered decision intelligence journey.

---

## Design Philosophy: The Falcon's Journey

### Core Metaphor
The website follows a falcon's hunting sequence:
1. **Observation** - High altitude surveillance (Hero)
2. **Target Acquisition** - Identifying the problem (Problem Section)
3. **Analysis** - Processing data and statistics (Analysis Section)
4. **The Dive** - Initiating action (Platform Section)
5. **Precision Strike** - Delivering solutions (Tools Section)
6. **Impact** - Measurable results (Results Section)

### Visual Language (Inspired by Pixelik)

#### Color Palette
```
--void: #0a0a0f          (Deep black background)
--laser: #00f0ff         (Primary accent - cyan)
--amber: #ffb800         (Warning/attention - gold)
--tactical: #1a1a24      (Card backgrounds)
--muted: #64748b         (Secondary text)
--danger: #ff4444        (Critical alerts)
```

#### Typography
- **Display**: Space Grotesk (headlines, bold statements)
- **Body**: Inter (readable content)
- **Monospace**: JetBrains Mono (data, code, terminal elements)

#### Key Design Elements from Pixelik
1. **Terminal/Command Line Aesthetic** - Code-like interfaces for data display
2. **Progress Indicators** - Animated percentage bars showing system status
3. **Glitch Effects** - Subtle digital distortion for tech feel
4. **Scan Lines & Noise** - Retro-futuristic texture overlays
5. **Numbered Sections** - [001], [002] style navigation markers
6. **Reticle/Target Overlays** - Lock-on animations for problem identification
7. **Data Rain/Matrix Effects** - Falling characters for coding atmosphere
8. **Shockwave Animations** - Impact visualization for results

## Technical Implementation

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React + TypeScript + Next.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Animations**: GSAP + ScrollTrigger
- **Smooth Scroll**: Lenis
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Fonts**: Space Grotesk, Inter, JetBrains Mono

### Animation Specifications

#### Scroll-Triggered Animations
1. **Parallax**: Background elements at 0.2x, mid at 0.5x, foreground at 1x
2. **Reveal**: Elements fade in + translate Y (50px) with stagger
3. **Count-up**: Numbers animate from 0 to target value
4. **Progress bars**: Width animates from 0% to target%

#### Continuous Animations
1. **Cursor blink**: 1s infinite
2. **Pulse glow**: 2s infinite on accents
3. **Data rain**: 50ms interval canvas animation
4. **Reticle rotation**: 20s linear infinite

#### Hover Effects
1. **Cards**: translateY(-8px) + border-color transition
2. **Buttons**: scale(1.05) + background transition
3. **Links**: color transition to laser cyan

### Performance Considerations
1. Use `will-change` on animated elements
2. Implement `prefers-reduced-motion` support
3. Lazy load below-fold sections
4. Optimize images with WebP format
5. Use CSS transforms instead of position changes

---

## Image Requirements

### Hero Falcon Images (3 phases)
1. **Observation**: Falcon silhouette at distance, wide landscape
2. **Analysis**: Falcon mid-dive, data overlays, tactical view
3. **Strike**: Falcon close-up, intense focus, impact imminent

### Style Guidelines
- Dark, moody atmosphere
- Cyan/laser accent lighting
- High contrast silhouettes
- Cinematic composition
- 4K resolution for retina displays
